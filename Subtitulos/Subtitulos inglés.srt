Hello everyone, my name is Ignacio Guarner

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,240
Sala and i am recording this video in representation

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,120
of MedConect, I am a co-author of this

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,280
web page alognside Aldrin Guzman Figueroa and we 

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
want to share our web page. This

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,520
page is a medical encyclopedia as we will

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,320
see

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,680
later. It is still unfinished but

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,039
already have something of value to show. First,

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
this is our index page, where we

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,960
have a header. Here we 

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,960
have a link to the University of

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,719
Alicante, here is for returning to the index,

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,960
a browser that we will see later and

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,160
other methods which we will also see

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,280
later. This is the index, here

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,280
the most important part is the 

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,239
medical encyclopedia, where the articles are 

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
organized alphabetically and the featured 

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,600
articles section, which shows articles

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,520
that may be of interest. Lets enter for

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,239
example in the C section, and in the C page 

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,760
we can enter in 

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,920
Coronavirus. Here we have a

25
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,559
table of contents, all the articles

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,239
have one. Here we have tje article itself,

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,760
a video and an interactive

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,880
map. I'm not going to use it right now

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,560
because all of the links are broken, but

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,159
you can click in the different

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,880
parts and it redirects to the different

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,799
countries. Let's return to 

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,600
index and let's see the browser. It

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,920
is very simple, first tou select the

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,680
category, the thing that you want

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,040
to search, if you want it to be 

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,960
searched ad an "and", an "or" or 

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,119
a "not" and finally you check this to

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,720
confirm the search. The browser

40
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,000
doesn't work right now, it send you to 

41
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,240
Search not found, but we will make 

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,880
it work. Let's go see Other methods, and

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,799
here we have a small page about the

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,680
human esqueleton, another interactive

45
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,840
map, this one dows work and it sends you to 

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,560
the Wikipedia article about the specific bone you 

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,240
choose and a table with all of the bones of the

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,600
human esqueleton. Let's return to the 

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,360
index. We have the featured articles section,

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,759
and let's see the page to sends us

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
a message to cantact 

52
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,079
us. 

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,399
You send a subject, your role,

54
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,439
the date of

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,640
birth, your sex, your email addres and

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,680
you check if you want to recieve more information. 

57
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,520
As you can see the subject and message sections 

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,959
have an asterisk. This is you signal that these 

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,040
are compulsory sections. If you try to send

60
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,200
a message without writing anything here it

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,200
laerts you with an error.

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,959
We also have a small quiz

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,760
wich is similar to the former

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
page.

65
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,800
You select your birth date, your age, a 

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,080
small cognicity 

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,319
test, your favourite color and your grade

68
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,200
of satisfaction. Again we have

69
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,640
compulsory

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,200
sections. We also have our accesibility

71
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,319
page, were we have our declaration of

72
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,159
accesibility,

73
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,480
some examples of accesibility in 

74
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,800
documents, what is accesibility and that 

75
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,800
we basically have a compromise to 

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,280
make our web page as

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,239
accesible as 

78
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,680
possible. FInally we have 

79
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,599
a table of contents for our whole

80
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,280
web page, which has all the relevant sections and links.

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,239
YOu can access the index, articles with 

82
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,400
a, articles with c, other methods, our

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,319
forms and the accesibility page. This

84
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,319
ia all and thank you for watching.
